# Project 1 - Demand Prediction for a Manufacturing Industry using Time Series Analysis
# 1. Managed a group of two for the data analysis of a manufacturing industry to predict the demand using Machine learning algorithms like ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM, and Fbprophet.
# 2. We cleaned the data by eliminating the incorrect and null values and the data were analysed for visual description. Later, the three different models were built using python to analyze and predict the demand.
# 3. LSTM provided an absolute error of 0.1368, Fbprophet provided an error of 0.675, and ARIMA & SARIMA of 0.793. Based on the error, we concluded as LSTM is the best Time series analysis technique for predicting the demand for the future.
